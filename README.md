# MX Code Challenge

This is my solution for the MX Web Scraping Code Challenge.

### Usage Instructions

Install dependencies and run the web-scraper using the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Implementation Assumptions

1. Based on the wording from the code challenge, I scraped the first page of Top-rated TVs only.
2. Some TVs do not list a price, because they are used and new TVs sold by third parties, so for those I simply print out 'No Price Listed'.
